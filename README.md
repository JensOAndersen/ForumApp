# Creating a Angular App as an excercise and introduction to the subject
Creating this app, along with its backend counterpart: https://github.com/JensOAndersen/ForumAPI, has been an interesting experience

I wanted to make this app as an introduction to Angular and Web API's, and i've learned a lot from the frontend:
  * Creating a basic app with Angular, routing, validation, authentication, localstorage, along with a host of other things
  
However, i've still got a lot to learn about Angular, i havnt even begun touching on Unit Tests yet. Other things i didnt manage to get working:
  * Redirecting back to returnURL on login
  * Text formatting in comments
  * Making new posts
    * I technically know how to do this, its a variant of new comment combined with the login form.
  * Editing posts
    * again, the API call is there, but the HTML and remaining code isnt there.
  * And so on, ideally i wanted this to be a fully functioning website, but there's too many loose ends in the backend and frontend. 
  
For the next project i'll probably start with the backend, make everything work, then begin constructing the frontend.
